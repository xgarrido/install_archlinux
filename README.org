#+TITLE: Arch linux minimal setup

This repository holds the =install.sh= script which will install a minimal set of packages given a
fresh installation of Archlinux.

You can execute it from a terminal with the following command (given that =curl= is already installed)
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xgarrido/install_archlinux/master/install.sh | bash
#+END_SRC
